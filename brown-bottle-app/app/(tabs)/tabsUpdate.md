# What I did
## Icons
I added SF Icons for IOS devices and Material Icons for Android/Windows. I mapped the icons in IconSymbol.tsx, then added them to their designated tab in _layout.tsx.

## Tab Folders
At first the tabs were files, but I was able to make them into folders and get them to redirect to each other. -- name="tasks/index"-- .The only issue is that I couldn't get the home page in a folder because the app wouldn't open anything if the index.tsx wasn't in the outside. This could be fixed later on, if we make another index.tsx for login, then I can put the current one inside of home/index.

## Theme
Added theme support for the tabs I made
