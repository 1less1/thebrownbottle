# Interview Notes

## Current Scheduling Technique
The Brown Bottle currently schedules with "paper and pencil". Employees hand in their availibility through notes and management fills out a spreadsheet template by hand. 
- There are different spreadsheets for each role. Ex: Schedule Spreadsheet for just Servers
- Friday, Saturday, and Sundays cannot be permanent days off
- Currently highlights workers age 16 or under since thye cannot work past 7:00 pm

## UI Design
- When an employee logs in they see a calendar. On the calendar their upcoming shifts are highlighted.
- Bottom Navigation Bar is preferred

## App Features
- Be able to pick a day and filter by restaurant section and/or role to see who is working
- If a worker has an approved permanent day off, it should be "greyed out" (unavailable) so they cannot be scheduled
- Time off requests can be sent in by employees. 
    * They should be "first come, first serve" (order by timestamp).
    * Manager can approve the time off requests in their portal
- Employees can look for someone to cover their shift.
    * Only employees of the same role can cover that shift.
        - kitchen can take **kitchen**
        - server can take **server**
        - bartender and server can take **bartender**
        - host and server can take **host**
    * When another employee takes the shift, the change will be sent to the managers for approval
- Each employee will have their own account with priveleges on the app that correspond with their roles in the restaurant
- Chats will be made for each part of the restaurant. Direct messages between employees is also an option but may be moderated

## Other
- 70 to 80 current employees at the brown bottle
- Want to meet monthly to go over progress. Also willing to take preliminary designs over email to give his personal input.
